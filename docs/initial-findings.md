# Initial Findings

We were able to scrape 237 data points from the National Park Service Soldiers and Sailors Database.  Many of the locations of these monuments correspond to battlefields or battalions, such as the Battles of Gettysburg or Vicksburg, and the battalions and regiments that fought at them.  The categorical information we found was name of monument, state, county and origin state the monument is erected for.

For our first visualization, we chose a bar graph. We felt, given the categorical information we had to work with, this was an effective way to show where the monuments were located in each of the states as well as the concentration in certain counties.  Since many corresponded to specific battles, the data was concentrated to the counties where those battles took place.

The bar graph is also supplemented with a table and rectangular visualization that provides the raw state and county data and a proportional rectangular shape diagram.  In each, the viewer is easily able to determine the high concentration of monuments in certain states and the distribution of monuments by county in those states.  The varying shades of blue also help convey this distribution effectively.

We also use two map illustrations: one displays the concentration of monuments by state, the other shows the concentration of monuments by their origins states.  For our data, most of the monuments were located in southern states, since most of the war was fought there.  The exception, Pennsylvania, corresponds to the northern most extent of the fighting, the Battle of Gettysburg.  Additionally, we found the origin states for much of our data actually came from northern, union states.  Interestingly, we found Ohio and Illinois had a high concentration of monuments dedicated to their soldiers.

While our data is limited since we are only applying data from a single database, these visualizations would be improved with more data points.  Furthermore, the National Park Service Soldiers and Sailors Database self acknowledges that its data is incomplete and that they intend to update it with more monuments in the future.  Overall, we believe these visualizations are an effective way to convey the data we found and a useful way to organize these categories.
