The National Park Service “Soldiers and Sailors” Online Database
	The National Park Service (NPS) online database contains over 6.3 million records pertaining to soldiers, sailors, battles, regiments, prisoner, and records on cemeteries, monuments, and Medals of Honor, all related to the Civil War. The database is online and contains primarily records of objects, as in the case of the monuments section, and service records for the soldiers and sailors who fought in the war. The NPS “Soldiers and Sailors” database is a project that is somewhat transparent in their methods of gathering, editing, and putting the records online, and was gathered by the NPS and other public and private institutions with certain goals in mind that somewhat produce biases in the display of the database.
	The NPS hosts the online database on their website, and it is mostly transparent in what sources were consulted for this project and how they transferred the information to an online platform, but not to what criteria and to what extent the records were edited for accuracy. The records in this database were collected in 2000-2001 by volunteers of the NPS. These volunteers used sources like the General Index Cards into the Compiled Military Service Records at the National Archives and were examined in combination with many other documents about Union and Confederate soldiers at the National Archives. According to the NPS website, the records “went through the enormous task of being edited for accuracy, consistency, etc. by two of [their]...main partners, the Genealogical Society of Utah and the Federation of Genealogical Societies.”  The NPS does disclose the other sources that were consulted, and the recording sequence on how the soldiers’ names and other information was transferred to an online, digital source. While the NPS does give some information as to how they gathered and transformed the data, including the multiple sources they consulted and the steps they took to put the information online, they failed to disclose what criteria that the records were evaluated for accuracy and to what extent they were edited.
	The NPS does have a mission statement, and their website notes that this database does go along with their mission because it “preserves unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations.”  The fact that this database was complied with a mission and objective in mind, means that it is somewhat biased towards the goals of the NPS, but it is still a useful starting place when looking for a simple search function for millions of records. The database also has other goals that were kept in mind when constructing it, because the NPS had public and private partners, including the African American Civil War Memorial, Civil War Preservation Trust, the African American Civil War Sailors Project, United States Civil War Center, and the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The goals of these other institutions are to make information about the Civil War readily available to the public and to “increase the American people's understanding of this decisive era in American history by making information about it widely accessible.”  The nature of this database and the fact that it was designed with the goals of these institutions in mind, only allows researchers to search for certain records and topics that were gathered with the objectives of the project in mind. Thus, to delve deeper into a certain subject, the researcher may need to look elsewhere. Overall, the database does not have too many biases pushing researchers to look into certain topics, and the fact that some of the institutions working on this project focus on African Americans and women leads me to believe this database will be somewhat diverse. The database also does an adequate job of divulging their source materials and the process the NPS went through to publish the materials on an online platform, but was not completely transparent in how, and to what extent they edited the records for accuracy.
