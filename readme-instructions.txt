CHRISTMAS GIFT TAGS
----------------------------------------

WHAT YOU'LL NEED:

• Printable download
• White card in stock of choice (preferably between 200-300gsm)
• Computer & printer
• PDF viewer (e.g. Adobe Reader)
• Hole Punch & Twine


THE STEPS:

1) Print out the gift tags on A4 or US letter paper (I like to use a thicker matte paper stock between 200-300gsm, fed through the rear tray of my printer). Make sure in your printer setup that your print quality is set to 'high'.

2) Using scissors, a blade or guillotine, cut around the dotted line on the outer edges (I like to use a guillotine to ensure my lines are straight).

3) Punch a hole in the top of the tag, add twine, write a special note on the back and attach it to your wrapped gift.
